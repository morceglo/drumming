## General info
In this study, we documented and experimentally characterized a novel drumming behavior in the disk-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor), showing that it is triggered primarily by interspecific intrusions. We quantified its occurrence, acoustic properties, and individual variation, proposing that drumming serves as a context-specific antipredator strategy. 

## Data
* [General data on drumming behavior](https://github.com/morceglo/drumming/blob/main/data.xlsx)
Key to listed variables: group = identity of social group, bat_id = last 4 digits of the RFID tag for each bat, trial = represents either the first or second trial in which we measured drumming behavior, sex = sex of the tested individual, time_drumming = total time the bat spent drumming within each trial, max_amp = average of maximum amplitude for all identified drumming events per trial (in dBFS), mean_amp = average of mean amplitude for all identified drumming events per trial (in dBFS).

* [Data on home range and other group traits](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/HR_Gsize.csv)
Key to listed variables: Group_ID = group identification number, HR = size of roosting home range (ha), Gprom_size = average group size, Gcrow_size = group size based on crowding, G_crowding2 = group size based on crowding.

* [Spatial distribution of tubular leaves](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/leaves.csv)
Key to listed variables: Fecha = date when a leaf was observed (day/month/year), Muestreo = sample identification, Hoja = leaf number, x = longitude, y = latitude.

* [Tubular leaves in roosting home range](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/leaves_inHR.csv)
Key to listed variables: ID_group = group identification number, N_leaves = number of tubular leaves observed, Muestreo = sample identification, HR = roosting home range, den_leavesHR = number of available tubular leaves in roosting home range, Gcrow_size = number of bats in the roost.

* [Average data for group's territories](https://github.com/morceglo/territoriality-in-disc-winged-bats/blob/main/TGH_prom.csv)
Key to listed variables: ID = group identification number, Gcrowding2 = average group size, DenH_prom = average density of tubular leaves in each group's territory, Area = size of territory (ha), Overlapping = average overlap of roosting home range (in %), Nleaves = number of leaves.
